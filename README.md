# Bun + React + API Framework Examples

This project demonstrates how to set up a modern web application using Bun with React, showcasing implementations of both Hono and Elysia web frameworks. While using both frameworks simultaneously isn't recommended for production, this project serves as a learning resource for comparing their approaches.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This is an educational project that demonstrates:
- Setting up a React frontend with Bun
- Implementing API routes using Hono
- Hono RPC
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation integration (http://localhost:3000/api/reference)
- Hot module reloading (HMR)
- Tanstack Router with @tanstack/router-cli
- Tanstack Query
- Mantine Component Library
- Supabase

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
