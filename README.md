# Bun + React + API Framework Examples

This project demonstrates how to set up a modern web application using Bun with React, showcasing implementations of both Hono and Elysia web frameworks. While using both frameworks simultaneously isn't recommended for production, this project serves as a learning resource for comparing their approaches.

## 🎯 Purpose

This is an educational project that demonstrates:
- Setting up a React frontend with Bun
- Implementing API routes using Hono
- Implementing API routes using Elysia
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation integration
- Hot module reloading (HMR)

## 🚀 Getting Started
